This project focuses on leveraging machine learning to address the critical challenge of heart attack prediction, aiming to enhance early risk assessment for individuals. Utilizing the Heart Attack Prediction dataset from Kaggle , I implemented a Logistic Regression model as the core predictive tool. My methodology involved a robust data preprocessing pipeline, including the transformation of complex features like blood pressure into numerical components and judicious handling of categorical variables. A stratified train-test split was meticulously applied to ensure objective model evaluation on unseen data, specifically accounting for class imbalance within the dataset. While the Logistic Regression model demonstrates foundational capability in identifying heart attack risk, my analysis of its performance metrics and feature coefficients highlights both its learning patterns and specific areas for refinement, such as addressing counter-intuitive feature impacts. This project establishes a groundwork for applying AI in health diagnostics, offering insights for future enhancements, including advanced model selection and hyperparameter tuning to optimize predictive accuracy and recall for at-risk individuals.
